Great application to refresh your working desktop with a beautiful picture. It refreshes every time when you unlock your phone, even if you just open an application.

You can set any text and application understands what picture you want to see (E.g.: "tech", "flowers", "girls","babes"). You don't need to worry about battery usage because the application wakes only once an hour and uses the latest API system for that.

Enjoy!
